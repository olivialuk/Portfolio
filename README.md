# Brainstorming and Interview - Tara

We began this process by talking about some of our current interests and people in our day to day lives that intrigued us. One of the things that came up was the idea of finding someone intentionally versus creating a “formula” that we all followed to interview someone (leave your apartment and walk 10 steps left and 10 steps right, talk to the first person you see), leaving whoever this person was to chance. 

Early on, we landed on the doing something **lighthearted, playful and something that reflected some sort of mundanity of life (perhaps one that we were unfamiliar with).**

We analyzed the purpose of humor and comedy in our own lives. Some of the things we were thinking about surrounding our theme: purpose, was

- active word (not passive) - doing, constant trial towards a goal
- struggle to find your purpose
- being in your 20s - defining part of our lives right now - figuring out our purpose
- how purpose is created for people?
- same story multiple meanings - how do different interpretations create different purposes?
- focus on the WHY of what people are doing
- how their purpose might change overtime?
- what is our publication’s purpose --> how do we want to tell, or help aid their story?

Our scope was wide, we explored financial domination, online sex workers, taxi and uber drivers, and random men on tinder. Someone brought up - “we should just interview frat guys with the same name”. And so we set out to find some who shared the same name. This was a new direction - not chance, not seeking out, but a simple name is the sole reason we choose to meet someone. 

**What are some common frat guy names?**

![Screen Shot 2023-12-18 at 2.41.16 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6b19f1bf-6b5b-4331-b740-00665544ca40/a40a4ad2-4552-414a-ae5a-8689ee1e5f89/Screen_Shot_2023-12-18_at_2.41.16_PM.png)

![Screen Shot 2023-12-18 at 2.42.10 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6b19f1bf-6b5b-4331-b740-00665544ca40/f16ec783-bdbe-45f8-af94-85e95658e12d/Screen_Shot_2023-12-18_at_2.42.10_PM.png)

So we began **RECRUITING.** 

We didn’t have any specific questions we wanted to ask. Our premise was to get to know these men as individuals, breaking away from their homogenous identity. We knew them as “Nick the frat guy”, but what if we dug deeper and took a moment to get to know them. We wanted Nick to feel welcome in the shooting studio, where we decided to conduct the interview. So we set off to create an appropriate set to match our vibes. 

![Screen Shot 2023-12-18 at 2.53.17 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6b19f1bf-6b5b-4331-b740-00665544ca40/3747e7de-f033-4a56-b723-eb3a46a0dc90/Screen_Shot_2023-12-18_at_2.53.17_PM.png)

As we conducted the interview, we also began thinking about visual directions. We liked the boldness of a singular name on the cover, and also explored portrait photography to accompany the style. Also, we looked into editorial magazine layouts as well as more “comic-strip” like layouts, since we wanted to add in illustrative parts as well. 

There was a lot of back and forth, solidifying concept and trying to find the line between “too on the nose” and not explicit enough. 

A part of this also was thinking about the names, and whether we wanted to include both Nick and Alexs or just nick. 

These were fun explorations, but we kept coming back to simplifying and trying to let the story shine. 

Once gretchen began illustrating, we knew we had made the right decision and allowed our type to take a step back to make those be the main moment.

A key moment for us was finding these reference images that typeset text in an unconventional manner. We loved hearing back the audio and hearing all of the awkwardness in getting to know someone, all the colloquial terms, and since the interview was pretty casual and conversational, gretchen and I being a part of it, breaking up the text like so felt exciting to us to pursue. In the bottom left pic, we also enjoyed how it played with illustrations. 

![Screen Shot 2023-12-18 at 3.02.28 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6b19f1bf-6b5b-4331-b740-00665544ca40/8479e4de-f998-4d76-a2f5-9de01c644e2a/Screen_Shot_2023-12-18_at_3.02.28_PM.png)

In our layout workshop, we tried to do some “cut-out” formatting. We envisioned a ping pong ball, where conversation went back and forth. 

We also discussed the pacing of our publication, as you read, you fill in the blanks with these individuals - which blanks change and which remain the same? What biases are you coming in with? We explored these through our covers as well. 

![Screen Shot 2023-12-18 at 3.03.27 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6b19f1bf-6b5b-4331-b740-00665544ca40/eb21b4d8-7a63-4008-a862-eb89bf1b07c3/Screen_Shot_2023-12-18_at_3.03.27_PM.png)

Collaborating was hard with indesign but we managed to figure things out eventually. We worked mostly during class time together and were pretty efficient in making decisions then. Making decisions and finalizing our typesetting style was tough since we explored a range of different things, though eventually in the process we all fell into roles that felt right for us. 

Working with the team was lovely and I felt we gave space for each other to work with our strengths and produce this in the best way we could. 

# Typesetting & Transcripts - Olivia

After putting the audio files into Otter AI we began to go through the transcripts to fix the AI errors and start annotating/adding hierarchy to the information. This pushed us to begin thinking about how we wanted to organize our publication and the overall story we wanted to tell. 

![an image of our shared drive, different versions of the transcripts](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6b19f1bf-6b5b-4331-b740-00665544ca40/e9852c06-c229-4e6d-b9a0-661157ffcdde/Screen_Shot_2023-12-18_at_12.15.28_PM.png)

To stay on the same page as we divided up transcripts, we set various systems of annotations

**A challenge we faced was figuring out how to feature the 2 conversations we had. Here are some things we tried…** 

For our first draft we decided to mix information from both interviews throughout the publication and divide the content into 4 sections: Introductions/Profile Questions, Purpose/Happiness Questions, Mental Health & Emotions Questions, & Silly/Random Questions

![Screen Shot 2023-12-18 at 12.39.42 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6b19f1bf-6b5b-4331-b740-00665544ca40/8be2d33b-acac-4581-bf43-98ba318939d4/Screen_Shot_2023-12-18_at_12.39.42_PM.png)

^ We all tried different ways of typesetting with the section we were assigned. Through layout + typesetting we were all trying to think about how to… 

1. organize these 2 different conversations
2. represent the different voices of the conversations
3. navigate through the long conversation
4. capture the unmodified conversational style of this interview + Nick’s unique/authentic voice (his pauses, his like’s, um’s, his frat vernacular, etc.)

A significant thing we had in common in all of our separate explorations was the use of **white space** to convey pauses/time, breaks in content, & add visual interest. 

We tried other ideas of combining these two conversations (like always putting Nick on the right page, and Alex on the left, etc.), but **we eventually decided to cut the Alex conversation**. This was a bit hard to do since we had put a lot of work into hosting the interview & figuring out how to combine the conversations, but this was overall the best decision. We had too much content as it was with just one conversation, the Nick content was richer since he opened up more being the only interviewee, and despite our efforts, it was too hard to tell a clear and compelling story with these 2 interviews. 

## Just Nick

As we went forward with just the Nick conversation we decided to get rid of the sections and display the conversation as it was chronologically, in real time/in the transcription. We wanted to keep the unique conversational style of the interview. *[side comment from Olivia: As someone who wasn’t at the interview, one thing that stood out to me that I really appreciated was how Gretchen & Tara relinquished control. This interview was lead by the natural forces of a conversation between 3 people, not the predetermined interview questions.]* We enjoyed things like the in between banter that smoothly led us from one question to the next, and the questions that popped up organically as the conversation trailed into unexpected directions. **We realized set up and tone of our interview, was just as important as the content itself.** 

![roughly laying out our more finalized content to understand the space it takes up](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6b19f1bf-6b5b-4331-b740-00665544ca40/88663bad-4648-46fe-aa55-fed92e08fa5b/Screen_Shot_2023-12-18_at_1.40.11_PM.png)

roughly laying out our more finalized content to understand the space it takes up

As we tried to finalize our unconventional typesetting system we struggled to **maintain hierarchy**. We had to ask ourselves what we wanted white space to indicate, and what we wanted different typestyles to indicate. We also had to ask what information we wanted to emphasize. Was it the like’s & um’s? Was it the pull quotes? The pauses? The person talking? The question being asked? etc.

more typesetting iterations

^ We tried putting the likes and um’s in a special typestyle, but that muddied the hierarchy. We realized different typestyles were best to highlight important content. We were interested in the like’s and um’s not because of their content, but because they conveyed the organic unrefined nature of the conversation. So we decided to move forward using different typestyles to highlight the quotes and questions, while we used spacing to highlight the like’s, um’s & pauses.

To help with hierarchy we also revisited our half-baked type system: 

![Screen Shot 2023-12-18 at 2.04.51 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6b19f1bf-6b5b-4331-b740-00665544ca40/daaed695-88c9-4467-9668-5c46e689a9f2/Screen_Shot_2023-12-18_at_2.04.51_PM.png)

The next problem we needed to tackle was figuring out **how to include Gretchen & Tara’s interjections**. The team enjoyed the back & forth nature of the conversation (like a ping-pong ball). We decided to put their interjections in a separate column alongside Nick’s main voice. We had to play around with the column structure again, as this new format took up much more space. We also played around with the justification a lot to make sure the reading direction was still clear. 

![Screen Shot 2023-12-18 at 2.13.16 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6b19f1bf-6b5b-4331-b740-00665544ca40/8601e183-5375-4584-9ab2-4c6de0367050/Screen_Shot_2023-12-18_at_2.13.16_PM.png)

- here we also decided to add in question titles. Though we didn’t want to break up the conversation, we ended up taking out too much of the content for the conversation to flow naturally. Inspired by the way Tara asked about Nick’s daily routine by saying “So what is the daily routine of like, a Nick?,” we decided to format all the questions in third person in order to further emphasize the name “Nick” [*one of my favorite touches! - Olivia]*

We ended up justifying Nick’s column (an opportunity our intentionally awkward spacing afforded us), left justifying Gretchen & Tara’s comments, having 3 columns, and adding lines between them for extra clarity.

# Illustrations - Gretchen

When i first begin ideating for ideas about the visual aspect of the project, I was looking into a variety of ideas, from photography to illustration to a combo of these. However, it was hard to narrow down on a style because we hadn’t figured out quite yet how we were going to frame the interviews. 

when laying out moodboards, I gathered some images of some of my ideas for both photography and illustration

![Screenshot 2023-12-19 at 3.07.56 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6b19f1bf-6b5b-4331-b740-00665544ca40/dcd4a29d-1b59-4204-bcad-2b412e8b3125/Screenshot_2023-12-19_at_3.07.56_PM.png)

![Screenshot 2023-12-19 at 3.08.06 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6b19f1bf-6b5b-4331-b740-00665544ca40/e93f68a9-c900-4a31-bf08-92aeb7550f9c/Screenshot_2023-12-19_at_3.08.06_PM.png)

the illustration style is heavily influenced by old cartoon style mixed with a sort of vintage game style . the colors are vibrant and full of life with lots of reds, green, and yellows. 

with the photography, its much more concept based, going off ideas of showing whats underneath or showing a side to a person that isn’t expected. however colorwise, its quite similar in its vibrancy. 

after inteviewing nick and two alexs, we also had some photos of table settings that used a mute navy and blues, along with a reinassance table setting. i was unsure, however if this would translate effectively to become to visual identity of the entire newsprint. it seemed a bit lacking in punch and it felt to me as though it didn’t have the spirit and liveliness that i might be able to create with illustrations. 

so i decided with our group that i was going to try out a first pass at an illustration style along with our typesetting experiements. 

![Screenshot 2023-12-19 at 3.16.13 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6b19f1bf-6b5b-4331-b740-00665544ca40/3f58b5eb-d8ed-480e-9d59-c7925b6a55d3/Screenshot_2023-12-19_at_3.16.13_PM.png)

Above was the result of this experiment. I tried using some of these punchy colors and illustrate in the style of some of the graphics i had pulled. however, to me it seemed not quite what I was imagining and it felt similar to my sardine illustrations last year. i wanted to challenge myself a bit with a grittier style.

also, we decided to pull back on the color for a bit since we could always add it back later and i made the decision to switch to just black and white illustrations, as it helps me focus on the compositions of the illustrations

i also wanted to make them a bit more exaggerated, loose, and fun, since these would be our sole visual element through the newsprint. 

So in my next iteration of the illustrations, I went for slightly different style and experimented with adding in some manipulated “frat” photography for a contrast between expected and unexpected visual content.

The left illustration I am not planning on using, however my group and I both really liked this style I had created for the right two illustrations, so I continued to draw more illustrations

My development process was kind of nonlinear, as ideas for what to illustrate for what part popped into my head at random times during the day or after scrolling through pinterest deepdive into cartoony old illustrations. often, I just started on one and the rest of the composition followed as I seemed to need certain elements. 

Our group also helped ideate things I could draw and for which sections of nick speaking I could draw illustrations for, and their continued joy when I showed them a new illustration made it easy to keep creating more. 

As we finally began to finish the typesetting formula, the illustrations started to go in and they looked wonderful next to the blank space utilized with our typesetting. Some illustrations needed adjustments to work in text, but other than that, the next step was to create the table setting for the opening page and develop a “all of nick” illustration for the back page. 

the table setting was an important aspect i brought up to our team as needing to include with our editors note, as it set the stage into sitting down to a conversation over food in order to meet a stranger. sitting down to a meal is one of the biggest ways in which we interact with and meet people in our life, so i thought this was an important image to illustrate. 

Also, i wanted to note that as the illustrations developed, we decided to not use the frat images in addition to the illustrations because we moved our idea more in a way in that it was about a conversation with a new person, one you may have stereotypes about becuase they are in a frat,  but the fraternal element wasn’t really something we needed to capitalize on anymore.

# Putting it all together - Tara

I put the illustrations and typesetting together. Integrated them so some intersected with the text.  Editing the text took a while - going back to our audio and fixing errors. We made sure to strike somewhat of a balance between the two, and left one quote page to really allow the illustrations to shine through. 

# Digital Animation - Gretchen

with the animation of the illustrations i had done, i wanted to incorporate movement in the places in which movement appeared as “stopped” in the illustrations

the emotional baggage illustration

was just calling for the man jumping off to be actually in motion jumping off, so thats what I animated

I went through a lot of my illustrations and animated them with this in mind along with a few of the stars or bubbly lines put in movement as well. for some, i also gave them the sketchy animation look for a differentiation in animation styles ( and to make some of them easier on me to convert)

this one was my favorite to animate—the eyes moving to watch the people running across was so fun and im glad the illustration got to live in motion for a digital experience

for the landing page, we decided as a team for the spinning table and nick walking up to the table as the chairs come in. this was slightly more difficult to animate since there was a more refined motion required and many more frames than just a repeating/looping gif of a few frames. but, i have done a variety of procreate animations, so it just took some time to create and i managed to make the motions work

# Digital - Christy

We moved to the digital part after we finished the printed publication. One thing we had in mind for sure was that the digital part will carry the same visual weight of the pulled quotes, because Nick said a lot of iconic phrases that really added personality to the publication. 

### Wireframing

Before coding or implementing the live site, we decided as a group what the navigation scheme should look like and what the landing page will be.

Olivia and Tara wireframed the pages on Figma and typesetted them, so the text boxes were directly transferrable to Framer. (theres a figma to framer copy and paste plugin!)

### Content

We spent some time figuring out the purpose of the digital site. We had two options for how much content we wanted to put into the digital version: only put in the beginning, the iconic snake part, and the ending so that the digital version would be a prelude or preview to the print. So it would be a “subscribe to see more!” type of vibe. 

But we realized the digital version should contain the full extent of the conversation too, because the purpose of this editorial lies in the full conversation with Nick.

### Landing

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6b19f1bf-6b5b-4331-b740-00665544ca40/55884735-ab46-4cb3-a565-44934205cdec/Untitled.png)

I played with the components aspect of Framer, so on click or on delay the component would transition into different variants to show the animation.

### Header Transition

One thing we figured out during the production of the website is how to manage the visual hierarchy of the top bar where the title NICK is static.  

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6b19f1bf-6b5b-4331-b740-00665544ca40/4812245a-692a-460d-bdd3-53bbc54a0df7/Untitled.png)

The top part felt very clunky and redundant with two “NICKS” used for different purposes. Since all questions were written in 3rd person’s perspective, we thought maybe we leave the name in each question blank and align is so that the center of each question would be “NICK,” and and the header falls directly into each question. This felt like a very interesting and fitting interaction that removes the redundancy but also emphasize “NICK”.

### Timer

A unique detail to our printed publication was the timestamps that give a transcript style, and we wanted to bring this aspect live in the digital version. This process involved a lot of of searching and chatGPTing😃, but I made it work! I need to fix the scrolling speed for each section to be different so that the timestamp at the end of the section is equivalent to the starting timestamp of the next section, but I think this will be a simple fix.

### Text Animations

Animating the text to appear one by one was the hardest part, even though it didn’t seem that difficult. The best I could achieve this effect is to making the texts control their delay till appearance and animation speed, but this would only work if you’re scrolling down slowly. Potential next step is to figure out how to make these animations dependent on the vertical scroll position.

### Sidebar

Because we have a long scroll content, we came up with the idea of a side bar lets you jumps between conversations like bookmarks.

Olivia’s Self Reflection: 

I really enjoyed this project—from the project’s content, to the technical processes, and my awesome team. There was something about this project and it’s process that really piqued my interest, and something that I took away from this project was learning about my what specific design interests might be. I don’t know if I can fully articulate it yet, but I really enjoyed telling a real person’s story. I enjoyed how connected this project was to the real world in that way. I liked exploring the complexity in this seemingly mundane person, and using design to extract and communicate that complexity. Along those lines, I loved having to solve the design problems of telling a story/reading a long form text like this. The way I viewed reading long form texts/stories like this before this project was quite one-dimensional. Discovering unconventional ways of typesetting, how still & moving images can interact with type, as well as the endless possibilities of scrolly-telling & interactive story-telling has has made me super excited & eager to explore this world. 

I also really enjoyed playing art director. Though we divided up a lot of the work, the whole team was very involved in ideation & design of all elements—whether that was drawing out rough sketches for Gretchen to illustrate in high fidelity, prototyping ideas on Figma for Christy to implement in code, or thinking about how these different elements might work together to tell Nick’s story. I loved thinking through the conceptual elements of this project, deciding how they would manifest across different channels. I am of course very thankful to have had a very skilled group that could help us realize all our ideas!
